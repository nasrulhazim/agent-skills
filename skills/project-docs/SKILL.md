  Full SDLC documentation toolchain for software projects — pre-development through post-release.
  Scaffolds numbered folder structures, generates Product Specs via interview, creates versioned
  roadmaps (Markdown table + Mermaid Gantt + GitHub Milestones + phase-based), builds support
  clusters (FAQ, triage workflow, SLA, post-mortem, deprecation), validates documentation,
  generates health reports with SDLC coverage scoring, and creates release notes from git logs.
  Use this skill whenever the user asks to create, scaffold, validate, or health-check project
  documentation — including: "set up docs for my Laravel package", "write a product spec",
  "generate a roadmap", "create an FAQ", "write a post-mortem", "generate a release note",
  "check my docs health", "add badges", "scaffold a support runbook", or "deprecate my package".
  Compatible with the nasrulhazim/claude-docs Claude Code slash command.

### Phase Filtering for Scaffold

| Flag | Folders Generated |
|---|---|
| `--phase pre` | `00-product/`, `01-architecture/` |
| `--phase during` | `02-development/`, `04-api/` |
| `--phase post` | `03-deployment/`, `05-support/` |
| `--phase all` (default) | All folders |

---

## 1. Scaffold New Documentation

### Step 1: Auto-Detect Project Type

| Signal | Project Type |
|---|---|
| `composer.json` + Laravel deps, `artisan` | `laravel` |
| `composer.json` + Livewire deps, Flux UI | `laravel-livewire` |
| OpenAPI/Swagger, REST/GraphQL description | `api` |
| `bin/` directory, CLI flags/commands | `cli` |
| "package", "library", "SDK", "client library" | `sdk` |
| Frontend + backend together | `fullstack` |
| `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt` | `python` |
| `Cargo.toml` | `rust` |
| `go.mod` | `go` |
| `Gemfile` | `ruby` |
| `*.csproj`, `*.sln` | `dotnet` |
| `pom.xml`, `build.gradle` | `java` |
| `pubspec.yaml` | `dart` |
| `mix.exs` | `elixir` |

If ambiguous, ask: "What type of project is this?"

### Step 2: Read Reference Files

- `references/scaffolds.md` — file contents per project type (during-phase dev docs)
- `references/sdlc-templates.md` — pre and post phase document templates

> **Livewire projects:** For `laravel-livewire` type projects, also scaffold Livewire component
> documentation in `02-development/`:
> - `04-livewire-components.md` — Component inventory, props, events, patterns

### Step 3: Generate Files

Apply [Linting Rules](#linting-rules) to every file. Present grouped by phase.
Always include root `README.md` with mandatory badges — see `references/badges.md`.

---

## 2. `/docs spec` — Product Specification (Interview Mode)

### Interview Phase

Ask questions in **three blocks**, one at a time:

**Block 1 — Core Identity**
- What is the product/feature name?
- What problem does it solve? (one sentence)
- Who is the target user? (be specific)

**Block 2 — Scope**
- What are the 3–5 key features in scope for this version?
- What is explicitly out of scope?
- What are the hard constraints? (tech stack, deadline, budget, compliance)

**Block 3 — Success**
- How will you know it's working? (metrics, KPIs)
- What does the minimum viable version look like?
- Are there any existing systems this must integrate with?

After Block 3, confirm: "Here's what I've captured — shall I generate the spec?"

### Generate

Read `references/sdlc-templates.md` → **Product Specification** section.
Populate every field from interview answers.
Mark genuinely unknown fields as `> ⚠️ TBD — needs decision` rather than leaving blank.

Output: `docs/00-product/01-product-spec.md`

### Requirement Design Phase Integration

For full Software Requirements Specification (SRS) and user story generation, this skill
delegates to the `project-requirements` skill:

- `/docs srs` — Invokes `project-requirements` to generate a complete SRS document.
  Output: `docs/00-product/04-srs.md`
- `/docs stories` — Invokes `project-requirements` to generate user stories with acceptance criteria.
  Output: `docs/00-product/05-user-stories.md`

If the `project-requirements` skill is not available, prompt the user to install it or
provide requirements manually for inclusion in the product spec.

---

## 3. `/docs roadmap` — Versioned Roadmap

Ask the user for: version targets, milestone names, dates or quarters, features per version.
If no dates given, use "Q1 2026", "Q2 2026" etc.

Generate all four formats in `docs/00-product/03-roadmap.md`.
Read `references/sdlc-templates.md` → **Roadmap** section for the full template.

**Format 1 — Markdown Version Table**

| Version | Milestone | Target | Status | Key Features |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| v0.1 | Alpha | Q1 2026 | 🔵 Planned | ... |

**Format 2 — Mermaid Gantt**

```mermaid
gantt
  title Product Roadmap
  dateFormat YYYY-MM-DD
  section Alpha
    Core features :2026-01-01, 2026-02-28
```

**Format 3 — GitHub Milestones JSON**

Fenced block the user can paste into a GitHub Milestones import script:

```json
[{ "title": "v0.1 Alpha", "description": "...", "due_on": "2026-02-28T00:00:00Z" }]
```

**Format 4 — Phase Summary**

```
Alpha (v0.1)  → Core features, internal testing
Beta (v0.2)   → External testing, feedback loop
GA (v1.0)     → Production-ready, full docs, SLA active
```

---

## 4. Reorganize, Validate, Update TOC

### Reorganize

Map current files → numbered SDLC structure. Show mapping first, get confirmation, then generate.

### Validate

| Check | Pass Condition |
|---|---|
| Numbered folders | All `docs/` subdirs prefixed `00-` through `05-` |
| README in each folder | Every `docs/*/` has a `README.md` |
| Main TOC | `docs/README.md` links all sections |
| Single H1 | Each `.md` has exactly one `#` heading |
| ATX headers | `#` style, not underline |
| Fenced code blocks | Triple backticks + language identifier |
| Line length | Prose ≤ 120 chars |
| Badges | Root `README.md` has version + license badges |
| SDLC coverage | `00-product/`, `02-development/`, `05-support/` exist |

### Update TOC

Scan each folder's `.md` files in numbered order. Replace between `<!-- TOC -->` /
`<!-- /TOC -->` markers, or insert after first `##` heading.

---

## 5. `/docs health` — Health Report

### Quality Score (60 pts)

| Metric | Max |
|---|---|
| Folder structure + README per folder | 15 |
| Badge compliance | 10 |
| Code block quality (language identifiers) | 10 |
| TOC completeness | 10 |
| Line length compliance | 10 |
| Single H1 per file | 5 |

### SDLC Coverage Score (40 pts)

| Phase | Folder | Max |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-Dev: Product | `00-product/` with spec + roadmap | 15 |
| During: Development | `02-development/` with getting-started + testing | 10 |
| Post: Support | `05-support/` with FAQ + workflow | 15 |

### Output Format

```

Issues Found:
  ❌ [HIGH]  05-support/ missing — run /docs support
  ⚠️  [MED]   00-product/03-roadmap.md missing — run /docs roadmap
  ⚠️  [MED]   No license badge in root README.md
  ℹ️  [LOW]   4 files exceed 120-char line limit

Recommendations:
  1. /docs support    → scaffold full support cluster
  2. /docs roadmap    → generate versioned roadmap
  3. Add badge: [![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/ORG/REPO?style=flat-square)](LICENSE)
```

---

## 6. `/docs support` — Support Cluster

Generates five files under `docs/05-support/`.
Read `references/sdlc-templates.md` → **Support** section for each template.
Ask for project name and context before generating.

| File | Content |
|---|---|
| `01-faq.md` | Common questions, troubleshooting, known limitations |
| `02-support-workflow.md` | Issue triage flow, response process, escalation path |
| `03-sla.md` | Severity levels, response times, resolution targets |
| `04-post-mortem-template.md` | Incident timeline, root cause, action items |
| `05-deprecation.md` | EOL announcement, migration guide, timeline |

---

## 7. `/docs runbook` — Ops Runbook

Ask: project type, hosting environment, deployment method (manual / CI-CD / Docker / k8s).
Read `references/sdlc-templates.md` → **Runbook** section.
Output: `docs/03-deployment/02-runbook.md`

Sections generated: pre-deploy checklist, deploy steps (numbered, atomic),
post-deploy verification, rollback procedure, emergency contacts.

---

## 8. Release Notes

User provides git log output (`git log --oneline --since="X"`).

| Prefix | Section |

---

## Linting Rules

| Rule | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Headers | ATX style (`#` not underline) |
| Lists | Dash (`-` not `*` or `+`) |
| List indent | 2 spaces |
| Line length | Prose ≤ 120 chars; code exempt |
